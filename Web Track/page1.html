            As you know my name is Kamal Koushik Duppalapudi <br> 
            I Studied pre-primary school in Rajasthan, but due to my problem in language grasping I had to get to it once again. 
            After that I moved to Hyderabad an there I joined Sri Chaitanya High school. 
            I joined lower kg in between the academic year. I completed lower kg in 6 months.
            I studies in Hyderabad for like upto 6th Standard in CBSE(Central Board of Secondary Educarion).
            I used to get very good grades in my tests but i was very lazy to study but I used to listen to the class very carefully.
            That is why I was taken into one of those special batches for teaching the advanced batch for teaching students syllabus of 
            upcoming standards which you are thinking is too much for the kids in that age.
            In 7th Grade , I was selected for the next stage of the filtering students with good grades.​​
            Then Unfortunately my father got his workplace transfered to Guntur.
            Now I study in Vijayawada (Beside Guntur). Everything was going on well in my new school.
            But then the CoronaVirus pandemic hit the Nation.Then I got introduced to CS50 by my brother.
            Now I am at a stage of well programming.
